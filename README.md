# ARRIVE
Augmented Reality Radiologic Image Viewing Environment (ARRIVE) is a system that brings MRI scans to life. It was built to assist clinicians and students visualize scans in a new modality. It consists of two applications that communicate over the web. The desktop app enables users to add MRI scan files to the system, and supports image management for different patients. The Microsoft Hololens application enables users to download scans and render them as translucent objects using a 3D texture. Users can interact with the scan objects using hand gestures or voice commands. Currently, users can translate, rotate, scale, and annotate scans.
